## Why You Should Learn Python?

Learning [Python](https://www.scaler.com/topics/python/) and writing computer programs is the profession valuable, this open doors for opportunity. The increase of Python Developers which is increasing drastically year by year, 25% of the total requirement is for Python. There is lot of opportunity for it.

## Why You Should Learn From it?

When you read some articles you will understand the quality and depth of these articles. Most important thing is, you will get certificate once you finish all the topics, which is free of cost, this will help you in your interviews.

**The articles are divided under 10 Modules, each modules will be covering some topics**
